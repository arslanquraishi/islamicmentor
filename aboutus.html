    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Islamic Mentor’s journey began over 25 years ago when our respected teacher established several institutes dedicated to providing Quranic and Islamic education. These institutions operated under various names but shared a common mission: to deliver high-quality Islamic education.</p>
    <p>Through these physical efforts, thousands of students have already benefited from Islamic education over the years, and even now, thousands of students are actively enrolled and learning through our established programs. Recognizing the growing need to expand beyond physical boundaries, we founded Islamic Mentor as an online platform to continue and amplify this legacy. Our goal is to bring Islamic teachings to every corner of the world, making education accessible to all, regardless of their circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Why Online?</h2>
    <p>The transition to an online platform was driven by the need to make Islamic education accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or schedule.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many people live in areas where quality Islamic education is either limited or unavailable.</li>
        <li>Islamic Mentor provides these individuals with the opportunity to learn authentic Islamic and Quranic teachings.</li>
        <li>Additionally, this platform caters to those with busy lives, enabling them to attend classes anytime, anywhere.</li>
        <li>This ensures that no one is deprived of Quranic and Islamic education due to location, time constraints, or lack of resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Legacy</h2>
    <p>Our respected teacher’s contributions to Islamic education span over two decades. His efforts have elevated the standards of Quranic education, with thousands of students benefiting from his guidance. Today, this legacy continues both in physical classes and through our online platform, where we strive to reach even more learners worldwide.</p>
